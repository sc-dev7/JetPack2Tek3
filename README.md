# **SCHOOL - Project**

## **DESCRIPTION**  
The **JetPack2Tek3** project involves creating a simulation game where a character equipped with a jetpack must navigate through a series of obstacles and reach a designated goal. The goal is to design a physics-based movement system that simulates the behavior of a jetpack, including propulsion, gravity, and collision detection. The program uses a simple 2D environment with various terrains and hazards.

## **FEATURES**  
- **Jetpack Movement:**  
  - Simulate jetpack propulsion with physics-based controls.  
- **Gravity and Terrain Interaction:**  
  - Implement gravity effects and terrain collisions.  
- **Obstacles and Hazards:**  
  - Include obstacles (e.g., walls, spikes) that the character must avoid.  
- **Goal Achievement:**  
  - The player must navigate the environment to reach a designated goal.  
- **Input/Output:**  
  - Control the character with keyboard inputs and display game progress.

## **FUNCTIONS ALLOWED**  
- **Standard Library Functions:**  
  - `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, `scanf`, `exit`, `fopen`, `fclose`.  
- **Graphics and Rendering:**  
  - Use a basic graphics library (e.g., SDL or ncurses) for rendering the game world.
